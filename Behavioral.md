- Tell me about yourself
  
I'm a full stack software engineer, specializing in web development in JavaScript.
I've worked on three apps in teams, and a couple smaller projects on my own.

Graduated in 2015 from Macaulay Honors College with a BA in a non-STEM major, but I've been pivoting into more tech-related roles. For example, I interned at a magazine as a PC Technology Reviewer, and also at a large medical practice in Soho working daily with medical software.

When it comes to engineering, I'm mostly self-taught, though I did also recently complete a software engineering immersive called Hack Reactor. They were on the news a few days ago because they were acquired by Galvanize. 

I'm seeking a full-time application developer role.
