**Continuous Integration and Deployment**

-  a development practice where developers push code into a shared repository frequently, and upon passing automated build tests, releasing the build to production
-  cycle of commit, deploy, test
-  importance of CI -> mention LinkedIn talk
  -  long integrations are exhausting
  -  more practice deploying makes deployment more enjoyable and easy; low-risk releases
  -  avoid merge hell (monster merges)
  -  easier to detect and locate bugs; less backtracking
  -  deliver features more rapidly; shorter iteration cycles
  -  more visibility -> more communication

### Practices
- single source repo
- automated build and deployment -> tests merges
- release good builds to production immediately
- "move fast and break things"
